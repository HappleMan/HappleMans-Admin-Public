# [HappleMan's Admin](https://happle.xyz/admin)

HappleMan's Admin started in 2020 as an admin script to moderate Roblox games. As time went on, it evolved into a free alternative to Discord's infamous paid use and freemium bots. Originally written in Lua, HappleMan's Admin serves Discord users as a completely free way to handle server management, moderation, and activities.

## Goal

HappleMan's Admin was created at a time when popular bots were being bought out and used for advertising, promoting cryptocurrencies and nfts, and even being banned from operating. I wanted to build something to both solve these problems and develop my skills in Lua and Python.

## Features

- Integrated commands list for user ease
- Basic and advanced moderation features, including command logging and message clearing
- Individual channel lockdowns
- Several distinct chat filters
- User ticketing system
